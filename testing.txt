deployments before crew members started accepting the risks relationships posed. The Federation soon saw that their
attempts to stop relationships from blooming was never going to work, and instead decided to regulate it in order to 
ensure good order and discipline. 

The rules governing relationships now state that they must be between members of equal or near equal ranks and that no
member of the relationship can work in the same section as any other member. In addition, the Captain has the authority
to regulate or deny relationships if doing so is considered best for the good order and discipline of the ship."""))
